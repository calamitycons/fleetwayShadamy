    narrator """My name is Amy Rose, and they don't call me 'Aim' for nothing!

    After we found our lost comrade Shortfuse the Cybernik, Tekno and I returned to Planet Mobius.

    On the way, we knocked into a hidden space station orbiting the world! Its old defence systems attacked us, forcing us to land and find the off switch.

    That was where we discovered him: black and red hedgehog held in suspended animation! He'd be lost if we shut the ship down with him still plugged in, so we took his tube with us first.

    Now Tekno and the Kintobor Super Computer are trying to revive him from stasis. I just wish I could do something to help. I'm bored out of my skull!"""
