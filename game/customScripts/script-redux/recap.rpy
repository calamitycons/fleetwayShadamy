    narrator """My name is Amy Rose, and they don't call me 'Aim' for nothing!

    My best mate Tekno and I found a hidden space station orbitting Planet Mobius! Its old defence systems kicked on, so we had to land our space ship and find the off switch.

    Hidden in the power core was a black and red hedgehog, held in suspended animation! He'd be lost if we shut the ship down with him still plugged in, so we took his tube with us first.

    Now Tekno and the Kintobor Super Computer are working at reviving him from stasis. But one question's still on my mind.

    What in blazes was he doing up there?"""
