    narrator """I'm Amy Rose the Hedgehog, and they don't call me Aim for nothing!

    I was in space with my best friend Tekno after we found out Shortfuse the Cybernik had been hanging out with mysterious aliens for months now! It took a while to get everything sorted out, but we managed to do it.

    We got home in a UFO that the aliens provided to us, but on the way we knocked into some mysterious building, and now the Guardian Units of Nations are after us!

    We didn't do anything wrong, but then we discovered a strange, black and red Hedgehog in the space station. He was being held in suspended animation. We couldn't leave the poor guy behind, so now Tekno and my old pal Porker Lewis are trying to revive him from his cage.

    I wonder what this guy was doing in there..."""
