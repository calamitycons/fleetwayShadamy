# Shadow the Hedgehog
define shadow = Character("Shadow", image="shad")

image shad = Image("images/chr/shadow/default/default.png")

## The above code was written by MadCreativity from Discord
## It's still not quite what I was hoping for, but I can try again another time later today to fix it up.
## Goal code:
# image shadow = getPose(status, pose)
# getPose checks to see what the character's status is, and then moves into the correct folder to acquire the pose.
# Is there a way to tie status into the character?
